=head1 NAME

C<rocknroll> - Rsync fOr baCKup and Roll

Light backup tool based on C<rsync>.

=head1 SYNOPSIS

  # rocknroll --init n tag dstdir           # initialization 

  # rocknroll [options] tag srcdir dstdir   # backup

  # rocknroll --help

  # rocknroll --man

=head1 DESCRIPTION

C<rocknroll> backups a remote directories tree C<srcdir> in local directory C<dstdir>.  
Using the C<link-dest> option of C<rsync>, it manages a set of differential archives, named
C<tag.1>, C<tag.2>, etc.

C<dstdir> can contain several set of differential archives. For example,
C<dstdir> can contain 2 sets named C<daily.1 daily.2 daily.3
daily.4 daily.5 daily.6 daily.7> and C<weekly.1 weekly.2 weekly.3 weekly.4>.

Before a C<dstdir> can be able to store an archive set, it must be
formatted with the C<--init> option.

=head1 ARGUMENTS

=over 4

=item tag

the name of the archive set.

=item srcdir

the topdir to backup, with the format of the srcdir of rsync : C<[[user@]hostname:]dir>

=item dstdir

=head1 OPTIONS

Almost command line options can be specified as well into the configuration file.

=over 4

=item -c C<config_file>

By default, the config file C<rocknroll.conf> is
searched in C<@/>, C<@/../etc/>, C</etc/>, C</etc/rocknroll.d/> (in this order)
where C<@> is the directory containing the rocknroll script.

=item --continue

start again with an existing C<.tag.running> archive (useful after an
abort)

=item --debug

=item --dry-run

don't perfom any action, just say what it could be done

=item --help

print usage

=item --man

it).  Don't roll the archives set.

=item --ro C<"--opt1 --opt2 --opt3">

=head1 CONFIGURATION FILE

Options are also taken from directives specified into C<rocknroll.conf>, 
a file located in C<@/>, C<@/../etc/>, C</etc/>, C</etc/rocknroll.d/>

=item --init C<n>

format a backup directory to receive C<n> archives.

=back

=head1 FILES AND DIRECTORIES

=over 4

=item rocknroll.conf

the configuration file

=item .C<tag>.ctl

a control file located in the archive directory, related to the C<tag>
archive set. 

=over 4

=item Note

This file stores the number of archives declared at the initialization of the C<tag> archives set. 
It is useful to recovery a normal state, in case of some archives disappear.
Normaly, the number stored in this file must match the number of current archives in the set.
If not, a warning is sent.
If this file is not found, it is re-create according of the current state of the archive set, and a warning is sent.

running rsync.

=head1 EXAMPLES

  # rocknroll --init 7 daily /var/backup/myserver
  # rocknroll --init 4 weekly /var/backup/myserver
  # rocknroll --init 12 monthly /var/backup/myserver
  
prepare the directory C</var/backup/myserver> to receive 3 sets of respectively 7 archives named C<daily>, 
4 archives named C<weekly> and 12 archives named monthly.

  # rocknroll daily myhost.mydomain:/ /var/backup/myserver
  
perform a new backup of C<myhost.mydomain:/>, add it as C<daily.1> to the archive set into the local directory C</var/backup/myserver>,
and roll the set C<daily>(forget the existing C<daily.7>)


=head1 SEE ALSO

C<rsnapshot>, <http://rsnapshot.org>. C<rsnapshot> and C<rocknroll> have similar
functionalities, and C<rsnapshot> has been the first on the place. But
when I began to think about C<rocknroll>, I've never heard of C<rnspashot>.
