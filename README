rocknroll - Rsync fOr baCKup and Roll

Light incremental backup tool based on rsync.

=head1 SYNOPSIS

rocknroll --init n tag dstdir

rocknroll [options] tag srcdir dstdir

rocknroll --help

rocknroll --man

=head1 DESCRIPTION

rocknroll backups a remote directories tree srcdir in dstdir onto the
local host.  For this
Â²backup, it manages a set of archives, named
tag.1, tag.2, etc.  Using the 'link-dest' option of rsync, it
keeps only the difference between the different archives.

A dstdir can contain several tagged sequences of archive. For example,
a dstdir can contain 2 archive sets named daily.1 daily.2 daily.3
daily.4 daily.5 daily.6 daily.7 and week.1 week.2 week.3 week.4.

Before a dstdir can be able to store an archive sequence, it must be
formatted with the --init option.
